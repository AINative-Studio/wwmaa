Subject: Critical Production Issue - Database Operations Returning 500 Errors ("super(): no arguments")

Hello ZeroDB Support Team,

We are developing the WWMAA (World-Wide Martial Arts Association) platform and have integrated ZeroDB as our primary database solution. We've encountered a critical server-side error that is blocking our production launch.

Our backend implementation follows your OpenAPI specification exactly, and we've successfully authenticated, but all database operations are failing with 500 Internal Server Errors.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ISSUE SUMMARY

Problem: All database table operations (list tables, query rows, insert rows) return HTTP 500 with error message: "Failed to list tables: super(): no arguments"

Impact: Complete authentication system failure - cannot read user data, blocking entire application

First Observed: November 12, 2025
Frequency: 100% failure rate on all database operations

ACCOUNT INFORMATION

- Account Email: admin@ainative.studio
- Project ID: e4f3d95f-593f-4ae6-9017-24bff5f72c5e
- Project Name: WWMAA
- API Base URL: https://api.ainative.studio

Authentication Status: ✓ WORKING - We can successfully authenticate and get JWT tokens

Database Operations Status: ✗ FAILING - All database operations return 500 errors

SPECIFIC ERROR EXAMPLES

Example 1: List Tables
---
GET /v1/projects/e4f3d95f-593f-4ae6-9017-24bff5f72c5e/database/tables
Authorization: Bearer [JWT_TOKEN]

Response: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
{
  "detail": "Failed to list tables: super(): no arguments",
  "message": "Internal server error"
}

Example 2: List Rows
---
GET /v1/projects/e4f3d95f-593f-4ae6-9017-24bff5f72c5e/database/tables/users/rows
Authorization: Bearer [JWT_TOKEN]

Response: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
{
  "detail": "Failed to list rows: super(): no arguments"
}

Example 3: Insert Row
---
POST /v1/projects/e4f3d95f-593f-4ae6-9017-24bff5f72c5e/database/tables/users/rows
Authorization: Bearer [JWT_TOKEN]
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "row_data": {
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password_hash": "$2b$12$...",
    "first_name": "Test",
    "last_name": "User",
    "role": "member",
    "is_active": true,
    "is_verified": true
  }
}

Response: HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
{
  "detail": "Failed to insert row: super(): no arguments"
}

ERROR ANALYSIS

The error message "super(): no arguments" is a Python error that typically occurs when:

1. Missing super() arguments in Python 2 style code - super() was called without class/self arguments
2. Class inheritance issue - A class is trying to call parent methods incorrectly
3. Python 2 vs Python 3 compatibility issue - Code written for Python 2 running on Python 3

Expected Behavior (per OpenAPI spec):
- List tables should return: {"tables": [...]}
- List rows should return: {"rows": [{"row_id": "...", "row_data": {...}}]}
- Insert row should return: {"row_id": "...", "row_data": {...}, "table_name": "..."}

What We're Seeing:
All operations fail immediately with a Python stack trace error before any database logic executes.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT WE'VE VERIFIED

✓ Authentication - Successfully obtaining JWT tokens
✓ Request Format - Following OpenAPI specification exactly
✓ Project Exists - Project "WWMAA" is ACTIVE with correct ID
✓ Tables Created - Successfully created 3 tables (users, profiles, events) earlier today at ~21:34 UTC
✓ Permissions - Using admin account with ADMIN role

**Key Finding:** Tables were creatable earlier today, but now queries fail. This suggests the error started occurring after table creation, possibly from a recent deployment.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IMPACT ON OUR APPLICATION

This issue is COMPLETELY BLOCKING our production launch:

Critical Failures:
✗ User authentication (cannot query user table)
✗ User registration (cannot insert into user table)
✗ User profile management (cannot read/write profiles)
✗ Event management (cannot read/write events)
✗ All authenticated features non-functional

Business Impact:
- Production launch delayed indefinitely
- 100+ test users waiting to access the platform
- Cannot proceed with user acceptance testing
- Considering database migration if issue persists

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU

1. Investigate the "super(): no arguments" error
   - Check server-side Python code for inheritance issues
   - Review recent deployments that may have introduced this bug
   - Check if this is affecting other customers

2. Review our specific project
   - Project ID: e4f3d95f-593f-4ae6-9017-24bff5f72c5e
   - Check server logs for our failed requests
   - Trace IDs available in all error responses

3. Provide ETA for fix
   - When can we expect this to be resolved?
   - Is there a workaround available?
   - Should we use a different API endpoint?

4. Consider rollback if recent deployment
   - If this was introduced in a recent update, can you rollback?
   - Tables were creatable earlier today but now queries fail

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

Our Implementation:
- FastAPI backend deployed on Railway
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Security implemented (CSRF, CORS, JWT validation)
- Extensive testing suite (11 test cases)
- Code quality: Production-ready and thoroughly reviewed

We're confident this is a server-side issue, not a client implementation problem. Our code follows your OpenAPI spec exactly.

Diagnostic Scripts Available:
We've created diagnostic scripts that can help you reproduce the issue if needed.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FALLBACK OPTIONS

If this issue cannot be resolved quickly (within 24-48 hours), we may need to:

1. Use alternative ZeroDB endpoints (if available)
2. Migrate to different database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
3. Request refund and discontinue ZeroDB integration

We would strongly prefer to continue using ZeroDB, but we have production deadlines to meet.
