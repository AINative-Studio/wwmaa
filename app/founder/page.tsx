          <div className="space-y-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              It is safe to say that there is no other person alive in the world today who has had so varied and comprehensive a career of achievement in Judo and the Martial Arts as Philip S. Porter. In every field of endeavor involved in Judo; from coaching, teaching and national and international leadership positions to writing, refereeing and building the theoretical framework of Judo, he has excelled. His competitive career spanned 50 years, culminating with four US National Masters Gold medals in winning which he never lost a match.
            </p>
            <p>
              He may be the only person who has refereed the finals in the world championships and fought in the world masters championships as well. During his many years in Martial Arts training, Porter has lived, taught and competed in Europe for four years; and lived, studied and competed in Japan for two years. From Thailand to Germany, from England to Brazil, he has studied, refereed, taught, and competed for 65 years.

            <p>
              O-Sensei (Teacher of teachers) Philip S. Porter began his Martial Arts career as a boxer 65 years ago – in 1943 at age 18. He was later a member of the West Point Boxing Team; and in 1950, Light Heavyweight Boxing Champion of the Western Area of the Air Training Command, USAF. Porter graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1948, and served in the U.S. Army and Air Force for 25 years, retiring as a major in 1967.
            </p>
            <p>
              O-Sensei started Judo, JuJitsu, and Karate training in 1951 while serving on a Strategic Air Command (SAC) combat crew at Travis Air Force Base, California. His first teacher was Sensei Walter Todd, 2nd Degree in Judo and the first American to be awarded a black belt in Shotokan Karate. Todd was later promoted to 8th Degree Black Belt in Shudokan Karate, and is now deceased. Because Porter was 27 years old at the time, he soon started teaching and coaching Judo as well as competing. Now, he is called O-Sensei because he is responsible for teaching and watching over the rank promotions of thousands of his Black Belt students and club leaders throughout the country in over 1,500 clubs of the United States Martial Arts Association.

                While in the Air Force, his first teacher was Walter Todd (later 8th Dan). In 1953, Sumiyuki Kotani (later 10th Dan) and Tadao Otaki (later 9th Dan) both accepted him as their student.

                Then O-Sensei trained in England at the famous Budokwai in London for a period of four years (1954 to 1958). At that time his teacher was Trevor P. Leggett, until his death the only 9th Degree in Judo in Europe, and one of only a few 9th Degrees in Judo outside of Japan.
