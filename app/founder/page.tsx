            <p>
              It is safe to say that there is no other person alive in the world today who has had so varied and comprehensive a career of achievement in Judo and the Martial Arts as Philip S. Porter. In every field of endeavor involved in Judo; from coaching, teaching and national and international leadership positions to writing, refereeing and building the theoretical framework of Judo, he has excelled. His competitive career spanned 50 years, culminating with four US National Masters Gold medals in winning which he never lost a match.
            </p>
            <p>
              He may be the only person who has refereed the finals in the world championships and fought in the world masters championships as well. During his many years in Martial Arts training, Porter has lived, taught and competed in Europe for four years; and lived, studied and competed in Japan for two years. From Thailand to Germany, from England to Brazil, he has studied, refereed, taught, and competed for 65 years.

          <div className="space-y-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              O-Sensei (Teacher of teachers) Philip S. Porter began his Martial Arts career as a boxer 65 years ago – in 1943 at age 18. He was later a member of the West Point Boxing Team; and in 1950, Light Heavyweight Boxing Champion of the Western Area of the Air Training Command, USAF. Porter graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1948, and served in the U.S. Army and Air Force for 25 years, retiring as a major in 1967.
            </p>
            <p>
              O-Sensei started Judo, JuJitsu, and Karate training in 1951 while serving on a Strategic Air Command (SAC) combat crew at Travis Air Force Base, California. His first teacher was Sensei Walter Todd, 2nd Degree in Judo and the first American to be awarded a black belt in Shotokan Karate. Todd was later promoted to 8th Degree Black Belt in Shudokan Karate, and is now deceased. Because Porter was 27 years old at the time, he soon started teaching and coaching Judo as well as competing. Now, he is called O-Sensei because he is responsible for teaching and watching over the rank promotions of thousands of his Black Belt students and club leaders throughout the country in over 1,500 clubs of the United States Martial Arts Association.

Many of these works outline and explain his own original theoretical contributions to Judo.

              O-Sensei Porter is called "The Father of American Judo" because he helped found the USJA in 1954, and personally built it into the largest Judo group in America, as well as the largest non-profit Martial Arts organization in the country, over a period of 41 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Founding The National College Judo Movement: In 1962 Porter hosted the first National Collegiate Judo Championships at the US Air Force Academy, wrote the constitution and bylaws of the first National Collegiate Judo Association (NCJA), and was elected as its Secretary. Later he was elected for a term as President of the NCJA.
            </p>
            <p>
              Porter founded and became President of the U.S. Martial Arts Association in late 1995. The USMA is the only non-profit American organization devoted to unifying the Martial Arts in our country, and recognizing all Martial Arts.
